# Welcome

## What are we building?

We're building a **blog feed aggregator** using Go! This web application will enable users to:

* Add blogs or feeds to be tracked and aggregated.
* Follow and unfollow feeds shared by other users.
* Fetch the latest posts from the feeds they follow.

This project is perfect for keeping up with your favorite blogs, news sites, podcasts, and more!

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have some basic knowledge of web development in Go and PostgreSQL. This project assumes you are familiar with concepts like web servers and databases.

## Learning Goals

* Integrate a Go-based server with a PostgreSQL database.
* Understand the fundamentals of database schema migrations.
* Learn how to implement background services for fetching and updating data.

## Setup

Here’s what you’ll need to get started:

1. **Text Editor/IDE**: [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is recommended, but any editor works.
2. **Command Line Interface**: Use a terminal or shell. For Windows users, [WSL 2](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install) is suggested to run Linux-based commands.
3. **Go Development Tools**: Install the latest version of [Go](https://golang.org/doc/install).
4. **VS Code Extension**: If using VS Code, install the [Go extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=golang.Go).
5. **HTTP Client**: Tools like [Thunder Client](https://www.thunderclient.io/) or Postman will help with testing APIs.

Once you're set up, you're ready to dive into building your blog feed aggregator!
